While working on this I didn't know what exactly you wanted for "reading from stdin"
so I chose to use the below way to run my code.

gawk -f LA-4 BldgPrmtsPublic10-01-2017To10-15-2017.csv >> web.html

I have included the blank web.html file incase you run the script in the same way.
Also LA-4 in the name of my program just incase.
